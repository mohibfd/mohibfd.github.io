        <h2>📜 Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          Graduated with a First-Class Honours in software engineering at the University of Glasgow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Software engineering is a passion for me; I enjoy programming and helping others code. I spend a good amount of my free time developing side projects, participating in hackathons, learning new programming languages and, most importantly, solving real-world problems using code.

        <p class="bullet-point">
          • Modernised the generation of our interest rate financial deals to utilise AWS S3 buckets and Aurora PostgreSQL instead of our on premises NoSQL databases. This resulted in a reduction of 60-75% in overall runtime.
        </p>
        <p class="bullet-point">
          • Aided in trade migrations to our downstream systems. We have successfully migrated on time for each migration.
        </p>
        <p class="bullet-point">
          • Modified our message structure for financial deals to conform with new regulatory requirements. This was achieved on time before the new requirements took place.
        </p>
        <p class="bullet-point">
          • Received a special case early promotion after my first year of employment because I exceeded expectations for my role. Only 10% of our software engineers globally get this promotion.
        </p>
        <p class="bullet-point">
          • Lead the tech side of a volunteering project with a charity. We built a React based web application that helps improve the mental health of teens. We built the project over the course of 9 months and received positive feedback from the charity throughout the project and after handover.
